# Data team coding exercise

## Running the code
The code can be executed by running:
```
python main.py
```

This will load the `components.csv` and `orders.json.txt` files and summarise the orders
as of `2021-06-03`.

To provide an alternative date to summarise at, call the `main` function with the desired date.

## Testing
To run the test suite, navigate to the `tests` directory and then run:
```
pytest .
```
